# K.load("README.md")
The K.load() working directory is YOUR SOURCE CODE that opens
you the gate to the LKSO NETWORKING ENVIRONMENT so you can
start earning for your work and receive also nice feedback
for your commits.

## The K.load("Challenge")
The K Challenge is what you need to finish up to start earning
your first 7 ktrust points and to earn more branch acceses. 
Also, the more ktrust points you earn the higher your minute per
push or rate per kvalue will also be higher. Your ktrust
points are what defines you as a "techie" developer in the
LKSO NETWORKING ENVIRONMENT. But do not worry! If you are not
a "techie" developer or even a developer we are not the
kind of network that do not have anything for you. Not because
we are using this way of knowledge and technology transfer does
not mean that you can not earn ktrust points. YOUR ktrust points
CAN BE EARNED and TRANSFORMED also into everything in the LKSO
NETWORKING ENVIRONMENT. The only difference between a "techie"
developer and a high ktrust LKSO NETWORKING ENVIRONMENT "user" is
that the "user" will not be able to access source code that the
LNSC have previously defined and signed. The "user" that forms
part of the LKSO NETWORKING ENVIRONMENT because of the high trust
points that his "account" "shows" then it means that the "user"
is either a "human" or a "bot" account that "serves" only to
"monitor and track" the "current branch" in which you are working
on. If the user is not properly identified with the LKSO NETWORKING
ENVIRONMENT "KSTAMP VISUAL AND KCHALLENGE METHOS" then please report
that "user" to the "LKSO HEALTHY SOURCE CODE COMMISSION" that
will get your report and perform the corresponding actions.
We also encourage you to report CVEs in our LKSO SECURITY CENTER.

~ The healthy very healthy branches should never have found CVEs ~

### K.load("Challenge.Steps")
The K Challenge Steps will be posted soon here.
By now. Please familiarize with the LKSO ktimestamp format
that we have for message signing.
